// inheritance  == the process where one class acquires the attributes and methods of another.
// helps in code reusability
// if you have an existing calss and if you want to build a new class that uses the stuff from the
// previous class and you want to build onto it


// subclass
// extended class
// child class


// super class
// parent class
// base class
